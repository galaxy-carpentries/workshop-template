# Important notes

The workshop is free of charge and covers:

- 3 days of training
- Coffee and tea over the days
- Lunch

No stipends for travel or accommodation are available.

Desktop computers will be available. You can also bring your *own notebook* if you prefer . Eduroam is available, ask your institute how to connect.

A **social dinner** will be organised at each site on Tuesday October 8th. This dinner will be at your own cost, but we would love to have a chat with you after the workshop!

# Workshop Format

This will be a **hybrid training**. This means the instructors will teach in front of a camera, and this video feed is live-streamed to multiple locations around the world. Each location will have several other instructors and helpers on site to answer questions and who can take over teaching in case this is needed.

We will use [a collaborative document (FIXME)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tN247JWpkpPl7FvEN9gsBcmVlZfRF_B0gnEWb5L3tMc) for asking and answering questions during the workshop. This document also contains links to all other materials you will need during the course.

# Preparation

The workshop will use the [European Galaxy server](https://usegalaxy.eu) to perform all data analysis. Please register there ahead of time to streamline the training.

You must go through two Galaxy interactive tours before beginning the training.
These interactive tours guide you stepwise through the Galaxy user interface
and the history. They will help you to follow the Galaxy introduction, and
ensure everyone has a basic understanding of how Galaxy works.

- [History Introduction](https://usegalaxy.eu/tours/core.history)

# Venues

This workshop will be offered in parallel in multiple locations:

## FIXME

{% assign loc = page.locations | where:"city", "Rotterdam" | first %}
{% include map.html location=loc showmap=true zoomlevel=15 hidepopup=true %}

The workhop will be held in room 1528 on the 15th floor of the Ee building. Computers are provided in this room. To enter the building you will need to pick up a visitors pass that will be waiting for you at the reception of the Ee building (3rd floor).

# Organizers, instructors and helpers

- FIXME

The team will be also instructors and helpers there, in addition to local helpers.

# Sponsors

This event is made possible thanks to our supporting partners:
